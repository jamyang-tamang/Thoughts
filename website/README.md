Hi there, this is my final thesis project Thoughts.
This application depends on Firebase and the npm packages react-canvas-draw and material UI

Within src [source] you will find my Assets file which contains all the images I used for this project and the Attributions for it.
You will also find the components, which is the main code for my project
The App.js file controls all the displaying pages of the project, and controls the login states.

The Canvas just has the Canvas.js file which is essentially the canvas itself, and the tool bar. This code controls all the tools the users use,
and the canvas drawings.
There is also a nav bar which allows for the swapping between pages

Discussions has 3 subfolders Comments, Discussions and Modals. These three files contain all the javascript for controlling Comments Dicussions and Modals
You can see the states that manipulate what is depcited and all the functions that triggers the changes.

The Interactions folder contains all the JS within the messaging system.

Rooms and Reports is a package that I haven't implemented yet

And you have the basic javascript for ForgotPassowrd and Login.
